# Unix 101 - introduction to Unix

## Description

Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser operating systems. The most famous 'Unix' is probably Apple's macOS.

## What is Unix?
[This page](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Unix-and-why-is-it-important) will give you some background information on Unix.

[This page](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html) will go into the technical details.

## More on kernels
Wikipedia has an extensive [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) on kernels.

## Most stuff just works
The cool thing about Unix and unix-likes, is that most software that works on one Unix system, will just work on or be easily portable to another Unix system.

They also come with a lot of the same (or similar) tools pre-loaded. This makes it rather simple to switch between them without having to relearn a lot (if anything at all).

## This documentation
If you are using the Opensource Academy documentation, make sure to use them with a Unix machine, either on a physical machine or a virtual machine.

This documentation will mostly refer to MacOS and Linux, but most of it should work fine with similar systems.
